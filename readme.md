### Description

In this project, I'm going to show container orchestratiton with docker compose for local development, docker swarm for simple projects and kubernetes for production.


### Installation

Since the project includes 3 tools, you should run all of them
```shell
# run docker compose
docker-compose up -d

# run docker swarm
docker swarm

# run kubernetes with minikube
minikube start
kubectl apply myproject.yaml
```
